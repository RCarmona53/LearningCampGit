# Learning Outcomes
# By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:

# Explain what a loop is and why itâ€™s useful.
# Explain what a loop loop is and how to use it.
# Explain what a while loop is and how to use it.
# Explain what a for loop is and how to use it.
# Explain what a #times loop is and how to use it.
# Explain what an until loop is and how to use it.
# Explain what #upto and #downto loops are and how to use them.

# loop
i = 0
loop do
  puts "i is #{i}"
  i += 1
  break if i == 10
end

# while loop
i = 0
while i < 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

# unitl loop
i = 0
until i >= 10 do
 puts "i is #{i}"
 i += 1
end

# Ranges
(1..5)      # inclusive range: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
(1...5)     # exclusive range: 1, 2, 3, 4

# We can make ranges of letters, too!
('a'..'d')  # a, b, c, d

# For loop
for i in 0..5
    puts "#{i} zombies incoming!"
  end

# Times loop
5.times do
    puts "Hello, world!"
  end

# Updo and downto loops
5.upto(10) {|num| print "#{num} " }     #=> 5 6 7 8 9 10

10.downto(5) {|num| print "#{num} " }   #=> 10 9 8 7 6 5
